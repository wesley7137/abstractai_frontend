# HR Policy and Conduct Violations:

###

- **False Accusations by HR Sheena**: Wes faced multiple accusations from HR Sheena, including telling an employee to steal something without permission, giving "push back", leaving a masterclass without notice, and resetting testers incorrectly. These accusations were often based on false information
- **Lack of Specificity**: The accusations were vague, lacking specific details about the incident, such as the exact words used, the context, and who made the allegations. This vagueness can undermine the credibility of the claims and make it difficult for you to defend yourself.
- **Failure to Address Directly**: It appears that HR did not approach you directly to discuss the allegations before reporting them to superiors. This could be seen as a failure to follow due process, where you should have been given an opportunity to explain your side of the story before any conclusions were drawn.
- **Defamation**: If the allegations are unfounded and have harmed your reputation within the company, you might have grounds to claim that the handling of the situation was defamatory. This could be particularly relevant if the accusations were shared widely without sufficient evidence.
- **Violation of HR Policies**: Most HR policies include procedures for handling misconduct allegations, including confidentiality, thorough investigation, and the opportunity for the accused to respond. If these procedures were not followed, it could be argued that HR violated its own policies.
- **Unprofessional Conduct**: The way the situation was communicated and managed might be considered unprofessional, especially if it involved spreading unsubstantiated rumors or not following up with a proper investigation
- **Inconsistent Feedback**: Wes received conflicting instructions from different supervisors, leading to accusations of not following protocols properly.

- Violation of Equal Employment Opportunity Laws
- Unequal enforcement of workplace policies may constitute discrimination if Wesley is part of a protected class.
- Retaliation for raising concerns about unfair treatment is prohibited under employment laws.

Hostile Work Environment
The persistent and pervasive nature of the negative treatment created a work environment that any reasonable person would find hostile and abusive.

Failure to Accommodate Mental Health Conditions
Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), employers are required to provide reasonable accommodations for employees with mental health conditions. Failure to do so may constitute a violation.
